# Fake_News_Detection-Project
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves a series of steps, including text pre-processing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Data Preparation and Exploration
The project uses training and test datasets provided as Excel files 
Preparing the data and handling missing values
Exploring the text data using WordClouds

## Text Pre-processing
Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization are applied to the text data.
Cleaning and preparing the text data to be fed into the machine learning models
## Features Extraction
TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words techniques are used to extract features from the text data.
Feature vectors are created and used for model training.

## Model Training
Logistic regression and multinomial Naive Bayes models are trained using the feature vectors.
The model is saved for deployment.

## Model Evaluation 
Model performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrices.
